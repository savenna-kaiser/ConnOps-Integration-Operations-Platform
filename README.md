## Why I Built This

[#why-i-built-this](#why-i-built-this)

At my company, many IT processes still relied on large PowerShell scripts, manual Active Directory operations, disconnected CSV exports, and no centralized audit trail. The result was significant operational friction:

- Onboarding/offboarding took too long
- Support staff manually logged into multiple enterprise systems for routine operations
- Every account or device change required navigating separate administrative interfaces
- Operational changes were difficult to trace afterward
- Repetitive workflows consumed large amounts of time
- Fragmented tooling increased context switching and overhead
- Support staff had inconsistent permissions

That meant constant context switching between Active Directory tools, Exchange administration, Citrix administration, inventory systems, and internal management portals — with no single source of truth.

This platform centralizes and standardizes those operations into a single product with a clean web interface, role-based access control, centralized audit logging, reusable backend actions, automation hooks, and operational observability.
> I strongly believe internal tools deserve the same product thinking as customer-facing software. Poor operational tooling creates hidden friction that compounds daily across support and infrastructure teams.

## Product Thinking

[#product-thinking](#product-thinking)

This project was intentionally designed like a product, not just an internal script collection.

| Goal                        | Implementation                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Reduce operational toil     | Centralized workflows + automation  |
| Prevent unsafe operations   | RBAC + validation layers            |
| Make actions traceable      | Structured audit logs               |
| Improve developer velocity  | Modular action architecture         |
| Support future integrations | Service-oriented backend            |
| Keep ops simple              | Minimal infrastructure requirements |

A major focus was balancing developer ergonomics, operational safety, extensibility, and low deployment complexity.

## Architecture

[#architecture](#architecture)

### Frontend

[#frontend](#frontend)

**Stack:** React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives, React Router

The frontend is intentionally thin — business logic lives in backend actions. Design goals: operational speed, low cognitive overhead, minimal clicks for repetitive tasks, fast rendering for large result sets.

### Backend

[#backend](#backend)

**Stack:** Node.js, Express, PowerShell integration layer, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Winston

The backend acts as the orchestration layer between Active Directory, Exchange, Citrix exports, Docusnap data, TopDesk, and internal automation workflows. A key architectural decision was separating routes, actions, services, and middleware — this made the codebase significantly easier to extend.

### Action-Based Architecture

[#action-based-architecture](#action-based-architecture)

One of the most important architectural decisions was introducing isolated backend actions:

```
routes/users.js
  → actions/user/disableUser.js
    → services/adClient.js
      → PowerShell worker
```

Benefits: easier testing, smaller failure surface, reusable business logic, centralized audit logging, cleaner authorization boundaries. The same pattern now extends to Exchange (`services/exchangeClient.js`) and TopDesk change execution.

### PowerShell Worker Pool

[#powershell-worker-pool](#powershell-worker-pool)

Active Directory and Exchange operations run through a shared PowerShell bridge with a worker abstraction layer, centralized execution, structured error handling, and isolated operational actions — reducing duplicated logic and shell execution risks while leveraging existing enterprise tooling.

---

## Auditability & Observability

[#auditability--observability](#auditability--observability)

Every critical action writes a structured log entry:

```
{
  "action": "USER_DISABLE",
  "actor": "admin.user",
  "target": "employee.user",
  "result": "success",
  "requestId": "uuid"
}
```

The logging pipeline includes SQLite audit persistence, rotating Winston log files, request correlation IDs, structured metadata, and CSV exports — making it possible to investigate incidents, track operational changes, debug workflows, and identify permission issues. Time-range reports (PDF/CSV) surface the same underlying data for admin review.

---

## Security

[#security](#security)

- Server-side RBAC
- Session-based authentication
- Input validation (Zod)
- Credential encryption
- Security headers (Helmet) and rate limiting
- Request auditing
- Middleware-based authorization
- Role separation

API security test collections (Bruno) cover unauthorized access, validation failures, RBAC bypass attempts, and invalid session handling.

## Technical Tradeoffs

[#technical-tradeoffs](#technical-tradeoffs)

**Split storage by data category (PostgreSQL + SQLite)** — organizational data and the change-queue (interrelated, relational data subject to active business-logic resolution) live in PostgreSQL, while the audit log (self-contained, append-only, immutable events) lives in a separate SQLite database. This keeps audit logging functional even if the operational database has an issue, without over-engineering a single shared store. See `docs/DECISIONS.md` (ADR-009 to ADR-011) for the full reasoning.

**PowerShell integration instead of LDAP rewrite** — the organization depended heavily on existing PowerShell AD/Exchange workflows. Rather than replacing everything at once, I built an abstraction layer that allowed incremental migration, operational continuity, and lower risk. This dramatically reduced implementation risk and now also carries the Exchange integration.

## Roadmap

[#roadmap](#roadmap)

The platform is actively evolving based on operational feedback and newly identified workflow bottlenecks.

### Secrets Management (In Planning)

[#secrets-management-in-planning](#secrets-management-in-planning)

Encrypting stored secrets (AD/Exchange/PostgreSQL/TopDesk credentials, session and webhook secrets) at rest via DPAPI instead of plain environment variables, reducing exposure if the host is compromised.

### Admin Console Expansion (In Progress)

[#admin-console-expansion-in-progress](#admin-console-expansion-in-progress)

The admin area currently covers role-to-permission assignment. Additional tabs (health, audit, TopDesk configuration, system, general information) are planned as incremental additions without breaking the existing structure.

### ITSM Integration (In Planning)

[#itsm-integration-in-planning](#itsm-integration-in-planning)

Deeper integration with the ITSM/ticketing system to automatically process HR-driven lifecycle events (onboarding, offboarding, department changes, role changes) — enabling the platform to orchestrate downstream AD/Exchange updates, permission adjustments, group membership changes, asset reassignment, and audit logging automatically.

### What's Next

[#whats-next](#whats-next)

**Product Analytics** — Instrumenting the platform with PostHog for workflow completion funnels, operational bottlenecks, feature usage, session replay for support flows, and role-specific usage patterns.

**Infrastructure** — Containerizing services and improving CI/CD automation.

**Frontend** — Implementing optimistic UI updates, better filtering, real-time operational updates, and keyboard-first workflows.

## Key Takeaways

[#key-takeaways](#key-takeaways)

This project required full-stack ownership — frontend UX, backend architecture, authentication, audit systems, infrastructure decisions, and deployment scripts. It reinforced that internal tools benefit from the same product discipline as customer-facing software: reduce friction, improve feedback loops, instrument behavior, ship quickly, and iterate continuously.
